# Regular Expression

Commonly called a “regexp”, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.

Regular expressions allow you to simultaneously perform a number of tasks:
* Find instances of a particular term …
* … even when there are variant (or fuzzy) forms
* Convert the term (or a part of it) into something else of your choosing
* Convert whole phrases (or even passages of text)
* Make changes to the whole text all at once, no matter how large or how many instances of your term there are
* Allow you to make changes consistently throughout 

Regular expressions are everywhere and software engineers will eventually have to use them during their careers. In this repo, we practice writing regexp in scripting using Oniguruma, a regular expression library which is used by Ruby by default.
