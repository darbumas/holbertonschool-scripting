# Regular Expression

Commonly called a “regexp”, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.

Regular expressions are everywhere and software engineers, no matter their positions, will have to use them during their careers. In this repo we practice writing regexp using Oniguruma, a regular expression library which is used by Ruby by default.
